If table does not have column id or user wants some other column to be considered as id attribute he can give key value in his payload as id_attribute : column name

Delete customer "12" from the "users" table
DELETE http://api.example.com/test/users/12/
If table does not have column id or user wants some other column to be considered as id attribute he can give key value in his payload as id_attribute : column name

We are following this convention as backbone also follows the same convention

Creating Database, Create tables with column:-

POST /database/ (create db) payload {'db_name':'value'}
DELETE /:database/ (delete db)
POST /:database/table payload {'table_name':'value', 'primary_key':'value', 'columns':{"column_name": "data_type"}} (create table)
DELETE /:database/:table (delete table)
